# RPGDice

Roll dice right from PowerShell!

## Overview

Quickly generate and roll dice. Have a game with a custom set of dice? You can
create a new custom dice and roll it.

This mostly stemmed from me wanting to learn how to use classes with PowerShell,
and a severe addiction to role playing games.

## Installation

```powershell
Install-Module RPGDice
```

## Examples
